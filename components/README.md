# PCbi components

This directory contains (or perhaps will contain in the future) PCbi component files that were contributed by users.

## How?

If you'd like to have a component you've created added to this repo - and, possibly, included with PCbi - please issue a pull request with it. The component will be accepted if deemed suitable.

Before contributing, please keep the following in mind:
- The component should be provided with a GPL3-compatible license (including for any assets that the component contains)
- For the component to be included with the binary distribution of PCbi, it should look like it belongs - same visual style, etc.

Instructions for creating components will be provided soon-ish
